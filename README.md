<p>This project covers the creation of a BDD driven selinum based automation framework within 4 hours </p>
<H2>How to run</H2>
Unfortunatly mvn clean test is currently not working, running the automatino framework will require a copy of intellij 
as well as both gherkin and cucumber plugins, this will allow indivudual scenarios to be ran 

<h2>Known issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>mvn commands currently do not function</li>
<li>Scotland happy path scenario in WhichCountryDoYouLiveIn Does not work</li>
<li>browser switching from chrome to firefox has been hardcoded</li>
